# Agent-First-Organization-Screening
This repository contains two folders, each representing a separate project I worked on at different times with Agent First Organization. Both projects focus on the development of the **JJ Lin Music Ambassador**, an AI agent designed to help users discover and appreciate JJ Linâ€™s music through personalized recommendations and contextual insights.

- **Apr_23_2025**  
  This folder contains my most recent experience with Agent First Organization.  
  - The `JJ_Lin_Music_Ambassador` subfolder includes the `config.json` file and evaluation outputs.

- **Dec_17_2024**  
  This folder corresponds to my experience from last winter with the organization.  
  - The `Bonus_HW` subfolder contains the `config.json`, evaluation outputs, and my responses to the survey from that period.
